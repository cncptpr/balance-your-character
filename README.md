### Branches

For everything your want to implement, make a brach like `feature/new-thing-i-want-to-add`. Or `bug/my-fix`, etc.
You are free to push to this branch.

When you are done with your feature or bug-fix create a Pull Request (PR) into the `develop` branch.
This need to be review by at least one person before you can merge.

The `develop` branch should always be "playable" (as much as the game is in the current state).

If there is a milestone reached, or a new version ready in the `develop` branch, it will be merged into the `main` branch.
